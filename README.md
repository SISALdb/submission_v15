### README: SISAL Submission Workflow 

1. Hello, congrats and thank you for choosing SISAL to upload your Speleothem data! 
This is an excellent choice, quite likely to improve visibility and boost citations of your work (1).				

2. You find enclosed in this folder two excel workbooks, which should be used to submit your data to the SISAL database. The main sheet to fill out is SISAL_workbook_v15_template, please follow the detailed instructions given in the INSTRUCTIONS tab carefully. After filling out the sheet, you can submit by sending an email to sisal.database@gmail.com.

3. The sheet has been developed by the global speleothem community over several iterations. It asks for a lot of metadata, so might need a bit of patience when filling it out for the first time. Yet, this is what makes the data in SISAL so valuable and versatile.

3. The sheet "Dating Conversion" is there to assist with the conversion of the format U/Th dates are provided by established labs to the format of SISAL. Please, follow as well the instructions given carefully.

4. The present version 15 of the upload sheet is optimised to enable submissions to SISALv3 (2) on a rolling basis, connected to the paleoecological database Neotoma (3). The SISAL-Neotoma data stewards will regularly release this data and the additional SISAL chronologies on Zenodo, from which Neotoma will pull the data.

5. Please note, that currently (June 2025) only the upload of single entities and not of composites is available through this pathway.

6. Regarding publication of your data together with a new publication, we recommend two possible pathways: 
		1) Upload the data in the worksheet format or a format of your choice in any data repository (e.g., the one from your university) to receive a doi immediately. Then, when submitting to SISAL make sure to link to your original submission by providing the dataset-DOI in the last column of the entity metadata tab. This ensures that the datasets are connected and can be traced back.
		2) Directly submit to SISAL-Neotoma, and we can generate a DOI for the dataset. Please reach out to sisal.database@gmail.com if you are interested in this option.
